I was asked not to publish the code, but I can provide it to you upon request.   
Here is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMbBKMTy5eM) demonstrating how the program works on Intel Core i5-8250U.

## Tasks
* Use face detection networks to detect all person on image
* Find out age and gender of all present on the image
* Also their emotions
* Recognize all persons
* If no matches found - add one to the database
* Repeat all of it with video
